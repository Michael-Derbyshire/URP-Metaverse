# URP-Metaverse

From this project I have realised I set my scope too broad in the "Fake it" instead of making it department.
This took increase the project time far past the 30 hours required with not much to show.

This is mainly due to issues with certain scripts I had to adapt and write from video inspiration on the internet that halted my time significantly.
